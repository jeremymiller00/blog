### SAN FRANCISCO COMPOSITE IS A DIVERSE GROUP OF YOUNG PEOPLE COMING TOGETHER TO SHARE THE EXPERIENCE OF MOUNTAIN BIKE RACING.

[Complete this form to register for the 2024-2025 season!](https://forms.gle/43vreV8V6881u6Nv5)

We've grown from four athletes to a close-knit team of about 40 riders from different San Francisco Middle & High Schools. Student athletes range from total beginners, to casual adventure seekers, to advanced competitive racers.

### WELCOME

Thanks for being interested in the San Francisco Composite Mountain Bike Team (aka “SF Composite” or “SF Comp”).  SF Comp is a co-ed club team open to any student attending middle or high school in San Francisco. Whether you’re an interested rider, parent, or coach, or a returning member of the team, this website is here to answer most of your questions. If you still have any questions, get in touch and we’ll take it from there.

Team philosophy: this team is about sharing the fun of mountain biking with teenagers, bringing those teenagers into a great community, and helping them improve as bike riders, teammates, and individuals. We also race. No racing (or biking) experience is required, just a positive attitude, a desire to learn, and a willingness to push yourself.

As with most things in life, what you get out of this team directly corresponds to what you put in. We spell things out more in the “Expectations” section, but the gist is this: you’ve gotta show up and you’ve gotta be willing to work hard. We have too many people interested in participating to fill the team with folks who don’t show.

### WE'RE PART OF A NATIONAL MOVEMENT WITH more than ten-thousand HIGH SCHOOL RIDERS NATION-WIDE.

SF Comp participates in the Central/East Bay Region of the NorCal League. The NorCal League ([www.norcalmtb.org](http://www.norcalmtb.org/)) is a part of a national organization called NICA ([www.nationalmtb.org](http://www.nationalmtb.org/)), whose mission is to help teens build strong body, mind, and character through interscholastic cycling programs that primarily focus on cross country mountain bike racing.

In the Central/East Bay Region, SF Comp competes against teams from SF/Berkeley to as far south as Fresno. At the end of the season we race with all teams in the NorCal League at the “Championship” race in May.

### OUR LEAGUE AND THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION SHARE A SET OF COMMON GOALS: TO GET MORE KIDS ON BIKES, FOSTER PERSONAL EXCELLENCE, RESPECTFUL TEAMWORK, A LIFELONG LOVE OF HEALTHY OUTDOOR ACTIVITY.

### **Commitment Expectation**

All riders are expected to attend a minimum of 2/3 of total rides/practices as well as all races. Consistent participation reduces risk of injury and increases the fun quotient.

### **Races**

The 2024 season races will be posted on the [NorCal League site](https://www.norcalmtb.org/). We will link to the 2025 schedule when it becomes available.

**Some of awesome venues we get to race at**:  Laguna Seca, Fort Ord East Garrison, Granite Bay, Six Sigma Winery (Lake County, CA), Petaluma, Swasey Trails (Redding, CA), and Exchequer (La Grange, CA)

_Usually most riders spend the night before at race location; a few travel the morning of the race. We’ll try to camp out as often as possible, as it saves a bunch of $ and is super fun._

### SF COMPOSITE IS A VOLUNTEER, PARENT-RUN ORGANIZATION.

*   Team coaches are all volunteers.
    
*   We ask that each team member pay a rider fee toward team expenses (including bike clothing \[team kit\], race & league registration, supplemental insurance, etc.)
    
*   We provide partial or full scholarships for those who need them.
    
*   We raise money through fundraising and sponsorships.
    
*   Many parents have assigned jobs for the season.  In addition, families need to do what they can to personally and financially support the team — offering rides, preparing and serving food, schlepping equipment, soliciting sponsorships, inviting friends to fundraiser, etc.

### OTHER IMPORTANT INFO

*   **Rider leadership roles**: There will be opportunities for team members to take leadership roles within the team. These will change throughout the year, and we’ll provide more details at the start of the season.
*   **Drug/alcohol policy**: Pretty simple: no breaking the law! We don’t tell adults not to have beer at the campfire, but we also don’t tolerate underage drinking or illegal drugs of any kind on SF Comp outings. We’ll simply ask you to leave the team.
*   **Coaches training**: All adults working with teens on SF Comp are required to register with NICA, which includes a background check and CDC Heads Up (concussion awareness) training. Coaches with more responsibility will have a higher level of training. More details here: [http://www.nationalmtb.org/coaching/](http://www.nationalmtb.org/coaching/)
